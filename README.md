## About

catfm, or **C**ool **A**nd **T**echnical **F**ile **M**anager was written to emulate the pluto file manager that I started working on in late 2018. Pluto was slow and buggy so I decided that I needed to rewrite it from scratch in a new language. So voil√†, you have catfm!

## Features

* Customizable file formating
* Opening files in your favorite programs
* Script intergration
* Bookmarks
* Tabs
* A customizable bar
* Overall aesthetic customizability

## Dependencies 

* ```go 1.13```
* ```tcell```
* ```bytefmt```
* ```copy```

## Building

**Clone the repository:**

```git clone http://github.com/geremachek/catfm```

**Tnstall go from your distro's repositories:**

**Install tcell:**

```go get github.com/gdamore/tcell```

**Install bytefmt**

```go get code.cloudfoundry.org/bytefmt```

**Install copy**

```go get github.com/otiai10/copy```

**Build the program**

Move into the ```catfm/``` directory and type ```go mod init``` and then ```go build```

**Move the binary to somewhere in your path**

## Configuration

You can configure the program in the ```config/config.go``` file before compiling. This speeds up the program as it doesn't have to read and parse a giant config file everytime you start up the program

I also recommend looking at the [tcell](https://godoc.org/github.com/gdamore/tcell) documentation on [color](https://godoc.org/github.com/gdamore/tcell#Color) and [styles](https://godoc.org/github.com/gdamore/tcell#Style)

### ```cd``` on exit

shell function (put this in your ```.shellrc```):

```bash
fm() {
	catfm && cd "$(< /tmp/kitty)"
}
```
